# Software-Test-Automation
This repository includes the artifacts worked on in the projects in the CS320 Software Test Automation Course at SNHU.These files also demonstrate my ability to create unit tests using code to uncover errors, analyze various approaches to software testing based on requirements, and apply appropriate testing strategies to meet requirements.

# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that the code is functional, unit tests for each method can be written and execute. Creating a high coverage percentage confirms that the enough of the program is being run when executing test. A high test coverage means a lower chance of leetting something slip through.


# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Creating a list of requirments from the user needs then using the requirments document to build methods that use conditional statements to ensure the program meets those requiments.


# How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software is rapidly evolving and the addition of units test throughout the devlopment lifecycle is now a part of that approach. After writing a new classs, I will now add test cases for each method to ensure that the initial requirments are met.
